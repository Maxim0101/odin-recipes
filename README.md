# odin-recipes

In this ODIN Project, I did the following:
- created a index / home page which stored a list of links to recipe pages
- created symmetrical recipe pages that had images, ingredients, instructions, and links both at the top and bottom of the page to go back home
- created images folder with images that recipe pages used for style
- created a coherent and logical file structure for the project by making an index.html, a README, a recipes / pages folder, and a images folder
