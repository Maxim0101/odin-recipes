            <li>Active Dry Yeast (2 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>Granulated White Sugar (2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil (2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour (4 cups)</li>
            <li>Salt (2 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>Pizza Sauce (8 oz)</li>
            <li>Mozarella Chesse (8 oz)</li>
            <li>Monterey Jack Cheese (6 oz)</li>
            <li>Pepperoni (optional)</li>
            <li>Spinach Leaves (1 cup, optional)</li>
            <li>Garlic Butter (as desired, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, pour in the warm water.</li>
            <li>Add the active dry yeast and sugar; let sit for 5 minutes until the mixture is frothy.</li>
            <li>Pour in the olive oil and gently stir with a spatula until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the flour and salt; mix with the spatula until a slightly sticky ball forms. Create a dough ball (using a bit more flour if needed).</li>
            <li>Transfer your dough ball to a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth.</li>
            <li>Split the dough in half and roll them into your desired shape. Transfer the dough to two sheet pans sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Poke holes in the dough with a fork to avoid the crusts puffing up. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425Â°F.</li>
            <li>Parbake the crusts for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the par-baked crusts and spread tomato sauce on each. Add your cheese, meats, and veggies on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 - 13 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and cheese is fully melted.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and brush the crusts with garlic butter.</li>
            <li>Top with your favorite pizza toppings: crushed red pepper, parmesan flakes, grated cheese, balsamic glaze, etc. Enjoy!</li>
